        blog: " Refraction AI unveiled its Rev-1 delivery robot in mid-2019. The Rev-1 looks like a cross between Starship’s smaller delivery robots and Nuro’s larger autonomous delivery vehicles. It can operate on either sidewalks or streets, weighs 100 pounds, has a top speed of 15 MPH, and is currently priced at $5,000. The REV-1 is outfitted with GPS, 12 cameras and sensors that let it navigate its environment.According to Refraction Co-founder Matthew Johnson-Roberson, services like DoorDash and Grubhub cost restaurants about 30% of an order total. For consumers, the cost of those delivery services is usually $3 to $5 plus tip, he said. Refraction is charging restaurants 10% to 15% and charging consumers $3. Refraction launched in Ann Arbor a pilot food delivery program in January with four restaurants and a few hundred participants. It plans to expand to a couple of other cities within six months.For what it’s worth, Nuro raised $940 million from Softbank in February 2019.",

        blog: "VR gaming is the term used to describe a new generation of computer games with virtual reality (VR) technology that gives players a truly immersive, first-person perspective of game action. Participants both experience and influence the game environment through a variety of VR gaming devices and accessories, including VR headsets, sensor-equipped gloves, hand controllers, and more.Virtual reality games can be played on standalone systems, specialized game consoles, or using advanced laptops and PCs that can power the leading VR headsets such as Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and Lenovo Mirage Solo.There are subsets of virtual reality gaming that use related technologies called augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR), where virtual elements are placed into the player's real world as viewed through a headset or camera. Lenovo Explorer uses the Windows Mixed Reality platform which, though still quite VR-focused, introduces new AR and MR experiences.",
